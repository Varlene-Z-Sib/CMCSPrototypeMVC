# Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)

The **Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)** is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of submitting, reviewing, and managing claims for lecturers and administrators. The system ensures a smooth workflow for tracking work hours, calculating payments, and approving or rejecting claims, all while maintaining secure role-based authentication.

## Features

### Lecturer Features
- **Submit Claims:** Lecturers can submit their claims with details such as hours worked, hourly rate, and supporting documents.
- **View Notifications:** Lecturers receive notifications about the status of their claims (approved, rejected, or pending).
- **Document Uploads:** Upload supporting documents in `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.xlsx` formats.

### Admin Features
- **Review Claims:** Administrators can view all submitted claims and their details.
- **Approve/Reject Claims:** Admins can approve or reject claims with status updates and notifications sent to lecturers.
- **Dashboard Overview:** A summary dashboard displays total lecturers, total claims, approved claims, and pending claims.

### Secure Authentication
- **Role-Based Access:** 
  - **Lecturer:** Access to submitting claims and viewing notifications.  
  - **Admin:** Access to reviewing claims and the administrative dashboard.
- **Secure Login System:** Users must authenticate to access their respective features.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core MVC
- **Authentication:** Cookie-based authentication
